I am a first year Ph.D. student in the Secure Web Applications Group at the [CISPA-Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de), where I am supervised by Dr.-Ing. Ben Stock.

My research interests include Application security, Network Security & Data Privacy. I currently focus on the the client-side security of Web applications and large-scale vulnerability detection.
